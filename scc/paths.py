SC-Controller - Paths

Methods in this module are used to determine stuff like where user data is stored,
where sccdaemon can be executed from and similar.

This is gui-only thing, as sccdaemon doesn't really need to load anything what
python can't handle.
All this is needed since I want to have entire thing installable, runnable
from source tarball *and* debugable in working folder.
